# ImageSizeReducer
This software is to make the digital images smaller in size so that they can be easily stored and shared.
The digital images that your camera produces usually take quite a lot of disk space. We want to keep all our memories but we don’t have enough disk space to keep all the images. On the other hand, Beggar size images are hard to share through emails and social media.
You can use this software to make the images smaller in size by reducing the resolution of the image. Your monitor usually have resolution such as 1366 X 768 etc. and most of the monitors never exceed the width of 2000. 
In this software, you can specify width or height of the resulting images and it will convert all the images in a particular directory, to that size. Which will result the size of the folder very much smaller (usually more than 1/20) but still you don’t see any difference when viewing in a normal monitor.
